# Doubts
1)  SOLVED : user which is signed in is not comming to the partials in views,for now i am passing the 'current_user' seperately while rendring the home.ejs file from home controller and using the 'current_user' in '_post.ejs' and '_comment.ejs'.


TODO :-
# AJAX
1) get user information without refresh
2) create and delete comments
3) display NOTY notifications

# File Upload
1) apply filters on the format size of file uploaded
